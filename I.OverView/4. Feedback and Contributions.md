#反馈和贡献

对于 how-to 问题或者诊断、调试问题，我们建议读者使用 StackOverflow，我们也来提供了一个
专用的[问题页面](https://spring.io/questions)，上面列出了建议使用的标签。 
如果你非常确定 Spring 框架存在某个问题，或者简要建议添加某个功能，
请使用[JIRA问题跟踪](https://jira.spring.io/browse/spr) 。

If you have a solution in mind or a suggested fix, you can submit a pull request on Github. 
However, please keep in mind that, for all but the most trivial issues, 
we expect a ticket to be filed in the issue tracker, where discussions take place 
and leave a record for future reference.

When contributing, please check out our Wiki on Github. While this reference is 
versioned and distributed with the Spring Framework, the wiki contains information 
that is not specific to any one version. For example, it has migration notes from 
earlier versions, comprehensive information on what’s new across multiple versions, 
contributor guidelines, the Spring Framework code style, and other information.
